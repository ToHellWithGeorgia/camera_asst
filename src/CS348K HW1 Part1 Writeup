CS348K HW1 Part1 Writeup
Zhihan Jiang - zhihanj

My image processing pipeline for part1 includes 4 parts: detecting and 
correcting static defects, demosaicking, denoising and global tone mapping.

1. Static defects:
I tried to use the methods in https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/ist/ei/2017/00002017/00000015/art00008?crawler=true&mimetype=application/pdf. In 
order to detect a defect, the following conditions must bet met: the pixel is 
significantly different from the same-color neighbours in the 5x5 Bayer window
(notice we are processing directly on Bayer raw input), and the local
brightness difference is significantly different from the highest/smallest
brightness difference in the 3x3 Bayer window. Combining the two we will have
a robust detection of the defects. For the correct, we simply take the median
of the 8 same-color sensor in the 5x5 window. Later in the assignment I will
try to implement a more sophiscated correction mechanism.

2. Demosaicking
We follow the instructions and use a bilinear demosaicking mentioned in the
slides. We mirror the edge for the image edge.

3. Denoising
We apply a 5x5 Gaussian blur kernel to the image. We use an approximate kernel
and decomposite the process into row convolution and column convolution. The
resulting image is less noisy.

4. Global tone mapping
I tried 3 ways of tone mapping: linear, tangent and gamma curve. The linear 
produces unsatisfactory images where the dark region of the image is too dark.
The tangent mapping I derive (42.36486 * (3.00957 + tan(2.5 * input - 1.25)))
is better at forcing the higher and lower pixels to the middle. The output
image is clearer than the provided reference solution, but is also darker.
The gamma curve is implemented as in the slides. It produces an image as good
as the reference image. I submitted the gamma curve one.
